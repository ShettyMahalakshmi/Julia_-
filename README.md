Julia	is	another	programming	language	that	is	high-level	and	high-performance and	is	used	for	numerical	computing.	It	provides	a	sophisticated	compiler, extensive	math	library,	numerical	accuracy,	and	distributed	parallel	execution. The	base	library,	which	is	mainly	written	in	Julia,	will	also	use	mature	and	bestof-breed	open	source	Fortran	and	C	libraries	to	help	with	string	processing, signal	process,	random	number	generation,	and	linear	algebra. Programs	with	Julia	are	created	around	several	dispatches,	which	will	allow user-defined	and	built-in	functions	that	can	be	overloaded	for	several	argument combinations. 


Some	of	the	main	features	of	Julia	include: 
An	open	source	and	free	MIT	license. Support	for	Unicode,	which	includes	UTF-8. Extensible	and	elegant	promotions	and	conversions	for	numeric	and other	types. 
Automatic	generation	of	specialized	and	efficient	code	for	several types	of	arguments. 
User-defined	types	which	are	quick	and	compact. 
Coroutines. It	was	created	from	distributed	and	parallelism	computation.
Powerful	shell-like	capabilities	for	managing	processes. 
The	ability	to	directly	call	C	functions. 
The	ability	to	call	Python	functions. Lisp-like	macros,	as	well	as	other	metaprogramming	facilities. 
A	built-in	package	manager. Great	performance	that	is	almost	like	languages	such	as	C Dynamic	type	systems. Multiple	dispatches.
How	to	Work	with	Data “No	great	marketing	decisions	have	ever	been	made	on	qualitative	data.”	– John	Sculley	
Once	you	have	your	data,	you	have	to	work	with	it.	In	this	chapter,	we	will	go over	the	different	waysto	work	with	data	such	as	cleaning,	munging,	rescaling, and	manipulating.
